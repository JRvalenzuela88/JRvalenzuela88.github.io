# Australian Open Datathon R Tutorial

## Overview
### The Task
This notebook will outline how the Betfair Data Scientists went about modelling the Australian Open for Betfair's Australian Open Datathon. The task is simple: we ask you to predict the winner of every possible Australian Open matchup using data which we provide.

The metric used to determine the winner will be log loss, based on the actual matchups that happen in the Open. For more information on log loss, click [here](http://wiki.fast.ai/index.php/Log_Loss).

### Submission
* To submit your model, email your final submission to datathon@betfair.com.au. Note that you don't need to email your code, just your predictions in the format that we have specified
* No submissions will be accepted prior to the Australian Open qualifying matches being completed and the final draw list being shared with registered participants (12 January 2019)
* Submissions need to include all potential match ups during the Australian Open, i.e. all possible combinations for each men's and women's tournaments (this will be provided after the draw is announced and the Australian Open qualifying matches are completed (Jan 12th 2019))
* Submissions must follow the format outlined above and shown in the 'Dummy Submission File'. Any submissions that are not in the correct format will not be accepted.
* Submissions need to include the player names for the hypothetical match up and the probability of the first player winning
i.e. player_1,player_2,probability_of_player_1_winning,
* Submissions must be in a csv format
* Only two models will be accepted per participant (one model for the men's draw, one model for the women's draw)

### Intention
This notebook will demostrate how to:

- Process the raw data sets
- Produce simple features
- Run a predictive model on H2O
- Outputs the final predictions for the submissions
- Load the data and required packages

``` r
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import os
import gc
import sys
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
import h2o
from h2o.automl import H2OAutoML


pd.options.display.max_columns = 999
```

``` r
# We are loading both the mens and womens match csvs
df_atp = pd.read_csv("data/ATP_matches.csv")
df_wta = pd.read_csv("data/WTA_matches.csv")
```

---
## Data preprocessing
Filter the matches to hard and indoor hard only due to the fact that Australian Open is on hard surface and we want the models to train specifically for hard surfaces matches

Convert the columns in both datasets to the correct types. For example, we want to make sure the date columns are in the datetime format and numerial columns are either interger or floats. This will help reduce the memory in use and make the feature engineering process easier

``` r
### Include hard and indoor hard only
df_atp = df_atp.loc[df_atp.Court_Surface.isin(['Hard','Indoor Hard'])]
df_wta = df_wta.loc[df_wta.Court_Surface.isin(['Hard','Indoor Hard'])]

### Exclude qualifying rounds
df_atp = df_atp.loc[df_atp.Round_Description != 'Qualifying']
df_wta = df_wta.loc[df_wta.Round_Description != 'Qualifying']

# Store the shape of the data for reference check later
atp_shape = df_atp.shape
wta_shape = df_wta.shape
```

``` r
numeric_columns = ['Winner_Rank', 'Loser_Rank', 'Retirement_Ind',
                   'Winner_Sets_Won', 'Winner_Games_Won', 'Winner_Aces',
                   'Winner_DoubleFaults', 'Winner_FirstServes_Won',
                   'Winner_FirstServes_In', 'Winner_SecondServes_Won',
                   'Winner_SecondServes_In', 'Winner_BreakPoints_Won',
                   'Winner_BreakPoints', 'Winner_ReturnPoints_Won',
                   'Winner_ReturnPoints_Faced', 'Winner_TotalPoints_Won', 'Loser_Sets_Won',
                   'Loser_Games_Won', 'Loser_Aces', 'Loser_DoubleFaults',
                   'Loser_FirstServes_Won', 'Loser_FirstServes_In',
                   'Loser_SecondServes_Won', 'Loser_SecondServes_In',
                   'Loser_BreakPoints_Won', 'Loser_BreakPoints', 'Loser_ReturnPoints_Won',
                   'Loser_ReturnPoints_Faced', 'Loser_TotalPoints_Won']

text_columns = ['Winner', 'Loser',  'Tournament', 'Court_Surface','Round_Description'] 

date_columns = ['Tournament_Date']

# we set the **erros** to coerce so any non-numerical values (text,special characters) will return an NA
df_atp[numeric_columns] = df_atp[numeric_columns].apply(pd.to_numeric,errors = 'coerce')
df_wta[numeric_columns] = df_wta[numeric_columns].apply(pd.to_numeric,errors = 'coerce')


df_atp[date_columns] = df_atp[date_columns].apply(pd.to_datetime) 
df_wta[date_columns] = df_wta[date_columns].apply(pd.to_datetime)
```

## Feature Engineering
The raw datasets are constructed in a way that each row will have the seperate stats for both the winner and loser of that match. However, we want to reshape the data so that each row we will only have one player randomly selected from the winner/loser columns and the features are the difference between opponents statistics (Difference of Averages), such as the difference between average first serve % in a single column rather than Player 1’s first serve % and Player 2’s first serve % in two separate columns.

In addition, for the features, we will take the rolling average of the player's most recent 15 matches before the particular tournament starts. For example, if the match is the second round of the Australian Open 2018, the features will be the last 15 matches before the first round of Australian Open 2018. The reason of not including the stats in the first round is that we would not have known the player's stats in the first round for the final submissions

A typical row of the transformed data will look like this – For a match between Player A – Roger Federer and Player B – Rafael Nadal, we will have a bunch of features like the difference in first serve %, difference in ELO rating etc. The target variable will be whether or not Player A wins (1=Player A wins and 0=lose).

The steps we take are:

- Convert the raw dataframes into long format:
- Create some new features
- Take the rolling average for each player and each match
    Since we will be only training our models on US Open and Australian Open, we will only be creating features for those matches. However, the rolling average will take into account any hard surface matches before those tournaments

- Calculate the difference of averages for each match in the data frames

---
## Convert the raw dataframes into long format:

``` r
# Before we split the dataframe into winner and loser, we want to create a feature that captures the total number of games the match takes.
# We have to do it before the split or we will lose this information
df_atp['Total_Games'] = df_atp.Winner_Games_Won + df_atp.Loser_Games_Won
df_wta['Total_Games'] = df_wta.Winner_Games_Won + df_wta.Loser_Games_Won


# Get the column names for the winner and loser stats
winner_cols = [col for col in df_atp.columns if col.startswith('Winner')]
loser_cols = [col for col in df_atp.columns if col.startswith('Loser')]

# create a winner dataframe to store the winner stats and a loser dataframe for the losers
# In addition to the winner and loser columns, we are adding common columns as well (e.g. tournamnt dates)
common_cols = ['Total_Games','Tournament','Tournament_Date', 'Court_Surface','Round_Description']
df_winner_atp = df_atp[winner_cols + common_cols]
df_loser_atp = df_atp[loser_cols + common_cols]
df_winner_wta = df_wta[winner_cols + common_cols]
df_loser_wta = df_wta[loser_cols + common_cols]

# Create a new column to show whether the player has won or not. 
df_winner_atp["won"] = 1
df_loser_atp["won"] = 0

df_winner_wta["won"] = 1
df_loser_wta["won"] = 0


# Rename the columns for the winner and loser data frames so we can append them later on.
# We will rename the Winner_ / Loser_ columns to Player_

new_column_names = [col.replace('Winner','Player') for col in winner_cols]

df_winner_atp.columns = new_column_names + common_cols + ['won']

# They all should be the same
df_loser_atp.columns  = df_winner_atp.columns
df_winner_wta.columns  = df_winner_atp.columns
df_loser_wta.columns  = df_winner_atp.columns


# append the winner and loser dataframes 

df_long_atp= df_winner_atp.append(df_loser_atp)
df_long_wta= df_winner_wta.append(df_loser_wta)
```

So now our dataframes are in long format and should looks like this

``` r
df_long_atp.head()
```

## Create some new features
Thinking about the dynamics of tennis, we know that players often will matches by “breaking” the opponent’s serve (i.e. winning a game when the opponent is serving). This is especially important in tennis. Let’s create a feature called Player_BreakPoints_Per_Game, which is the number of breakpoints a player gets per game that they play (even though they can only get breakpoints every second game, we will use total games). Let’s also create a feature called Player_Return_Win_Ratio which is the proportion of points won when returning.

Similarly, “holding” serve is important (i.e. winning a game when you are serving). Let’s create a feature called Player_Serve_Win_Ratio which is the proportion of points won when serving.

Finally, you only win a set of tennis by winning more sets than your opponent. To win a set, you need to win games. Let’s create a feature called Player_Game_Win_Percentage which is the propotion of games that a player wins.

So the four new features we will create are:

- `Player_Serve_Win_Ratio`
- `Player_Return_Win_Ratio`
- `Player_BreakPoints_Per_Return_Game`
- `Player_Game_Win_Percentage`

``` r
# Here, we will define a function so we can apply it to both atp and wta dataframes
def get_new_features(df):

    # Input: 
#     df: dataframe to get the data from

     # Return: the df with the new features
    
    
    # Point Win ratio when serving
    df['Player_Serve_Win_Ratio'] = (df.Player_FirstServes_Won + df.Player_SecondServes_Won - df.Player_DoubleFaults) \
                                  /(df.Player_FirstServes_In + df.Player_SecondServes_In + df.Player_DoubleFaults)
    # Point win ratio when returning
    df['Player_Return_Win_Ratio'] = df.Player_ReturnPoints_Won / df.Player_ReturnPoints_Faced
    # Breakpoints per receiving game
    df['Player_BreakPoints_Per_Return_Game'] = df.Player_BreakPoints/df.Total_Games  
    df['Player_Game_Win_Percentage'] = df.Player_Games_Won/df.Total_Games

    return df


# Apply the function we just created to the long dataframes
df_long_atp = get_new_features(df_long_atp)
df_long_wta = get_new_features(df_long_wta)
```

``` r
# The long table should have exactly twice of the rows of the original data
assert df_long_atp.shape[0] == atp_shape[0]*2
assert df_long_wta.shape[0] == wta_shape[0]*2
```

## Take the rolling average for each player and each match
To train our models, we cannot simply use the player stats for that current match. In fact, we wont be able to use any stats from the same tournament. The logic behind this is that when we try to predict the results in 2019, we would not know the stats of any of the matches in the Australian Open 2019 tournament. As a result, we will use the players' past performance. Here, we will do a rolling average of the most recent 15 matches before the tournament.

To do the above, we will follow the steps below:

1. List all the tournament dates for US and Australian Opens
2. Loop through the dates from point 1, for each date, we filter the data to only include matches before that date and take the most recent 15 games
3. Take the average of those 15 games

``` r
# the two tournaments we will be using for training and thus the feature generation
tournaments = ['U.S. Open, New York','Australian Open, Melbourne']

# Store the dates for the loops 
tournament_dates_atp = df_atp.loc[df_atp.Tournament.isin(tournaments)].groupby(['Tournament','Tournament_Date']) \
.size().reset_index()[['Tournament','Tournament_Date']]

tournament_dates_wta = df_wta.loc[df_wta.Tournament.isin(tournaments)].groupby(['Tournament','Tournament_Date']) \
.size().reset_index()[['Tournament','Tournament_Date']]


# We are adding one more date for the final prediction
tournament_dates_atp.loc[-1] = ['Australian Open, Melbourne',pd.to_datetime('2019-01-15')]
tournament_dates_wta.loc[-1] = ['Australian Open, Melbourne',pd.to_datetime('2019-01-15')]
```

Following are the dates for each tournament

``` r
tournament_dates_atp
```

|Tournament|Tournament_Date|

They look fine but it is interesting that for men's, we have two more years of data from 2012 to 2013

#     rolling_cols: columns to get the rolling averages

     # Return: the df with the new features
    
    
    # Sort the data by player and dates so the most recent matches are at the bottom
    df = df.sort_values(['Player','Tournament_Date','Tournament'], ascending=True)
    
    # For each tournament, get the rolling averages of that player's past matches before the tournament start date
    for index, tournament_date in enumerate(date_df.Tournament_Date):

## Calculate the difference of averages for each match in the data frames
In the original data frames, the first column is always the winner and followed by the loser. Same for the player stats. Thus, we cannot simply calculate the difference between winner and loser and create a target variable indicating player 1 will win or not because it will always be the winner in this case (target always = 1). As a result, we need to pick a player randomly so the player might or might not be the winner

In addition, instead of using both the features for player 1 and 2, we will take the difference of averages between the randomised player 1 and 2. The main benefit is that it will reduce the number of features to half

Steps:

1. We will create a random number for each player which only return 0 or 1
2. If it is zero, we will assign the winner to player 1 and loser to player 2
3. We will join the features to the player 1 and 2. The join will be on the player names and the tournament date (tournament_index in the feature dataframes)
4. For players who do not have any history, we will fill the stats by zeros and rank by 999

``` r
# Randomise the match_wide dataset so the first player is not always the winner

# set a seed so the random number is reproducable
np.random.seed(2)

# randomise a number 0/1 with 50% chance each
# if 0 then take the winner, 1 then take loser

df_atp['random_number'] = np.random.randint(2, size=len(df_atp))
df_atp['randomised_player_1'] = np.where(df_atp['random_number']==0,df_atp['Winner'],df_atp['Loser'])
df_atp['randomised_player_2'] = np.where(df_atp['random_number']==0,df_atp['Loser'],df_atp['Winner'])

df_wta['random_number'] = np.random.randint(2, size=len(df_wta))
df_wta['randomised_player_1'] = np.where(df_wta['random_number']==0,df_wta['Winner'],df_wta['Loser'])
df_wta['randomised_player_2'] = np.where(df_wta['random_number']==0,df_wta['Loser'],df_wta['Winner'])

# set the target (win/loss) based on the new randomise number
df_atp['player_1_win'] = np.where(df_atp['random_number']==0,1,0)
df_wta['player_1_win'] = np.where(df_wta['random_number']==0,1,0)


print ('After shuffling, the win rate for player 1 for the mens is {}%'.format(df_atp['player_1_win'].mean()*100))
print ('After shuffling, the win rate for player 1 for the womens is {}%'.format(df_wta['player_1_win'].mean()*100))
```

After shuffling, the win rate for player 1 for the mens is 49.64798919857267%
After shuffling, the win rate for player 1 for the womens is 49.697671426733564%
The win rates are close enough to 50%. So we are good to go

Now we have gotten the rolling averages for both player 1 and 2. What we need to do next is to simply calculat their difference.

To calculate the difference, we need to:

1. Split the dataframes into two new dataframes: Player 1 and Player 2
2. Take the difference between the two dataframes

``` r
def get_player_difference(df, diff_cols = None):
        
        # Input: 
#     df: dataframe to get the data from
#     diff_cols: columns we take the difference on. For example is diff_cols = win rate. This function will calculate the 
#                difference of the win rates between player 1 and player 2

     # Return: the df with the new features
    
    p1_cols = [i + '_p1' for i in diff_cols] # column names for player 1 stats
    p2_cols = [i + '_p2' for i in diff_cols] # column names for player 2 stats


    # For any missing values, we will fill them by zeros except the ranking where we will use 999
    df['Player_Rank_p1'] = df['Player_Rank_p1'].fillna(999)
    df[p1_cols] = df[p1_cols].fillna(0)
    
    df['Player_Rank_p2'] = df['Player_Rank_p2'].fillna(999)
    df[p2_cols] = df[p2_cols].fillna(0)

    
    new_column_name = [i + '_diff' for i in diff_cols]

    # Take the difference
    df_p1 = df[p1_cols]
    df_p2 = df[p2_cols]
    
    df_p1.columns=new_column_name
    df_p2.columns=new_column_name
    
    df_diff = df_p1 - df_p2
    df_diff.columns = new_column_name
    
    # drop the p1 and p2 columns because We have the differences now
    df.drop(p1_cols + p2_cols, axis=1, inplace=True)
    
    # Concat the df_diff and raw_df
    df = pd.concat([df, df_diff], axis=1)
    
    return df,new_column_name
```

``` r
diff_cols = ['Player_Serve_Win_Ratio',
            'Player_Return_Win_Ratio',
            'Player_BreakPoints_Per_Return_Game',
            'Player_Game_Win_Percentage','Player_Rank']

# Apply the function and get the difference between player 1 and 2
df_atp,_ = get_player_difference(df_atp,diff_cols=diff_cols)
df_wta,_ = get_player_difference(df_wta,diff_cols=diff_cols)

# Make a copy of the dataframes in case we need to come back to check the values
df_atp_final = df_atp.copy()
df_wta_final = df_wta.copy()
```

``` r
df_atp_final.head()

## Modelling
We will trian two models here, one for mens and one for womens.

For training, we will use all available data from the second year (too many missing values in the first year) up until 2017.

For validation, we will test the model on the 2018 Australian Open data

This setup allows us to 'mimic' the final prediction (using historical matches to predict 2019 results)

``` r
df_train_atp = df_atp_final.loc[(df_atp_final.Tournament_Date != '2018-01-15') # excluding Aus Open 2018, and
                                & (df_atp_final.Tournament_Date > '2012-01-16')] # excluding first year
df_valid_atp = df_atp_final.loc[df_atp_final.Tournament_Date == '2018-01-15'] # Australian Open 2018 only

df_train_wta = df_wta_final.loc[(df_wta_final.Tournament_Date != '2018-01-15') # excluding Aus Open 2018, and
                                & (df_wta_final.Tournament_Date > '2014-01-13')] # excluding first year

We will do the differencing again for the prediction dataframes exactly like what we did for training

``` r
# Apply the function and get the difference between player 1 and 2
df_predict_atp,_ = get_player_difference(df_predict_atp,diff_cols=diff_cols)
df_predict_wta,_ = get_player_difference(df_predict_wta,diff_cols=diff_cols)
```

## Make the prediction

``` r
df_predict_atp_h2o = h2o.H2OFrame(df_predict_atp[feats])
df_predict_wta_h2o = h2o.H2OFrame(df_predict_wta[feats])

atp_preds = aml_atp.predict(df_predict_atp_h2o)['p1'].as_data_frame()
wta_preds = aml_wta.predict(df_predict_wta_h2o)['p1'].as_data_frame()

df_predict_atp['player_1_win_probability'] = atp_preds
df_predict_wta['player_1_win_probability'] = wta_preds
```

``` r
atp_submission = df_predict_atp[['player_1','player_2','player_1_win_probability']]
wta_submission = df_predict_wta[['player_1','player_2','player_1_win_probability']]
```

``` r
atp_submission.head()
```

Let's look at who has the highest win rate from our models

``` r
atp_submission.groupby('player_1')['player_1_win_probability'].mean() \
.reset_index().sort_values('player_1_win_probability',ascending=False).head()
```

|player_1|player_1_win_probability|
|-|-|
|novak djokovic|0.846377|
|juan martin del potro|0.787337|
|karen khachanov|0.782963|
|rafael nadal|0.778707|
|roger federer|0.767337|

``` r
wta_submission.groupby('player_1')['player_1_win_probability'].mean() \
.reset_index().sort_values('player_1_win_probability',ascending=False).head()
```

|player_1|player_1_win_probability|
|-|-|
|madison keys|0.750580|
|naomi osaka|0.749195|
|caroline wozniacki|0.722409|
|kiki bertens|0.713904|
|aryna sabalenka|0.707368|

Now we can output the predictions as csvs

``` r
atp_submission.to_csv('submission/atp_submission_python.csv',index=False)
wta_submission.to_csv('submission/wta_submission_pthon.csv',index=False)
```

``` r
atp_submission.shape
```
