# Bet Angel Pro: Automating simultaneous markets

## Dont miss out on a market with simultaneous automation

If you have a concern of missing markets due to delays or unforeseen circumstances, Bet Angel is able to work off multiple worksheets for different meetings, all from the same workbook. 
For example, if we are wanting to automate markets at 1.45pm at Swan Hill, 1.55pm at Townsville and 2.02pm at Menangle, but the Swan Hill market is delayed, we don't want to miss out on the Townsville or Menangle markets.

To set this up, we need to make sure that there are enough instances of the ‘Bet Angel’ worksheet to cover markets in the event of a delay or on track issue. In this context, three worksheets should be enough to cover the days markets if some of them are delayed for whatever reason. 

We've created a special Excel file with macros that will allow up to three markets to be linked at the same time. These macros automatically clear the contents of each sheet when they detect a market change and clear any errors that may occur. If you want to have more worksheets to be linked to different markets, you will need to update the macros accordingly so that they all work independently from one another.

    Please note that the above edited excel workbook does not include any automated strategies. You will need to add this in yourself or take a look at our [Multiple market ratings tutorial](/thirdPartyTools/BetAngelMultipleMarketRatings/)

Once this is done, save the file and close out of it completely (Bet Angel will open it back up for us automatically when we’re ready to start our automation). 
In Bet Angel, follow the usual process of clicking the ‘Guardian’ Icon, select your markets and the usual ‘Browse for file’ button to locate your Excel file. 

The only thing you will need to do differently for Bet Angel is to simply allocate a specific worksheet to a particular market that you are betting on. As each market concludes, the assigned worksheet will then reset and then re-assign itself to the next market in the guaradian list.

When you’re ready for automation to take over, click the ‘Connect’ check box and then it will do its thing.

### And you're set!

Once you've set your spreadsheet set up and you're comfortable using Bet Angel Pro it should only take a number of seconds to load your markets and set your strategy running for the day. Just make sure you have all of the app settings correctly selected before you leave the bot to run, as some of them reset by default when you turn the program off.

!!! info "Note:" 
    You will need to leave your computer up and running for the duration of the chosen markets, as the program needs the computer to be 'awake' to be able to run.
