Geeks Toy is a 3rd party program that uses the Betfair API. Essentially, it is a dedicated platform that can utilise the Exchange in ways the website and mobile app cannot. It is built to be able to enhance the experience of the Exchange for the punters and potentially increase the amount the punters benefit from the exchange. This guide aims to help get a better look into Geeks Toy and how to set it up and take a further look into the features that it offers.

## **Basic Set Up & Settings** 
Congratulations, now you have access to one of Betfair’s most popular 3rd party apps. But where do you go from here? Next, we will look at the basic set up and settings that Geeks toy has to offer so that you may be able to maximise your experience using Geeks Toy. 

**Market Navigator** 

The first screen you will see once logged in is the “Market Navigator” screen.

*Market Navigator Screen*  

This is the main screen you will see when logging into Geeks Toy. From here You will be able to access all the markets that are available via the Betfair Exchange. By navigating through the menus, you will be able to find any horse race, any soccer or AFL match that you would normally find through the Betfair website. From this screen, you will also be able to select which market you would like to be involved in the event. You can also access a whole host of other options from this screen by right clicking.

*A list of potential widgets ready to customise.* 

A unique and attractive feature of Geeks Toy is its fully customisable interface in that you can pick and choose what you would like to see, make it as big or small as you like. This allows for an experience and for punting that suits your needs. 

**Profiles can be Saved and Opened after creation** 

Once you have gotten your ideal view or setup, you may realise that this is ideal for horse racing, but not so much for a soccer game. You can then choose to save your horse racing “profile” so that you may create another view that is better for soccer, which when created you can save as your soccer “profile”. The profile in this case is the way you have manipulated the widgets to get the specific experience you are wanting to achieve. The handiness of this feature is it allows quick and easy access between different profiles, and more importantly, not having to construct the profile each time. If you are having troubles figuring out a profile to begin with, click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcW2pSAI8Io) to watch pro Geeks Toy trader, Caan Berry, do a tutorial on setting up a profile.

**Ladder View of the markets** 

One of the other features that Geeks Toy offers is the “Ladder view” of the markets. Essentially, the ladder view is beneficial to punters as it can show not only the best back and lay prices, as well as the next 2 best prices on both sides, but it goes into greater depth in that it is able to go back further and still show how much money is available. This then helps give a better idea of how the selection has traded thus far and where the money is currently, so that you may be able to get those better odds, all refreshing with Geeks Toy impressive 200 millisecond refresh rate.
