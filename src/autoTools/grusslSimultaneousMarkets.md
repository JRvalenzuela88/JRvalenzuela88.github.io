# Gruss: Automating simultaneous markets

---
## Don't miss out on a market with simultaneous automation

If you have a concern of missing markets due to delays or unforeseen circumstances at a market, Gruss is able to work off multiple worksheets for different meetings, all from the same workbook. 
For example, we can have worksheet one from our spreadsheet work through the markets taking place in Flemington, while worksheet 2 will work through markets at Sandown, worksheet 3 works through markets at Bendigo etc. 

To Set this up, we need to do need to duplicate the main ‘Market’ worksheet and have enough instances of the sheet for each meeting. There are four meetings that I want to cover, so I have duplicated the worksheet four times and renamed them to help me keep track.

After these changes have been made, restart Gruss so that the changes go into effect. Once Gruss is back open, as before, click ‘Market’, ‘Add to Quick Pick List’, ‘Horse Racing’ (Or any event you are automating for), the country that you would like to bet and then ‘All Win’.

This should generate a bunch of tabs in Gruss, each tab containing all the markets for a specific meeting. Simply close the ones you don’t want. 

Once you’re ready, click the ‘Excel’ menu in Gruss, and ‘Log Multiple sheets Quick link’. Select your Excel Workbook, assign the worksheets, select ‘Enable Triggered Betting’, “CLEAR trigger clears matched odds’, ‘Clear bet refs on auto select markets’, ‘Clear bet refs on manual select market’ and finally ‘Auto Select First Market’. Your screen should look something like this:

When you’re ready for automation to take over, click ‘Start logging’ at the bottom of the window.

### And you're set!

Once you've set your spreadsheet set up and you're comfortable using Gruss it should only take a number of seconds to load your markets and set your strategy running for the day. Just make sure you have all of the app settings correctly selected before you leave the bot to run, as some of them reset by default when you turn the program off.

!!! info "Note:" 
    you will need to leave your computer up and running for the duration of the chosen markets, as the program needs the computer to be 'awake' to be able to run.
