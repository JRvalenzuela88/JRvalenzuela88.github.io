    "# Betfair Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Betfair Data is a very fast Betfair historical data file parsing library for python. It currently supports tar archives containing BZ2 compressed NLJSON files (the standard format provided by [Betfair's historic data portal](https://historicdata.betfair.com/#/home)).\n",
    "\n",
    "The library is written in Rust and uses advanced performance enhancing techniques, like in place json deserialization and decompressing Bz2 encoded data on worker threads and is ideal for parsing large quantities of historic data that could otherwise take hours or days to parse.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install betfair_data\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: requires Python >= 3.6.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import betfair_data\n",
    "\n",
    "paths = [\n",
    "    \"data/2021_12_DecRacingAUPro.tar\",\n",
    "    \"data/2021_10_OctRacingAUPro.tar\",\n",
    "    \"data/2021_11_NovRacingAUPro.tar\",\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "market_count = 0\n",
    "update_count = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "for market in betfair_data.TarBz2(paths):\n",
    "    market_count += 1\n",
    "    update_count += 1\n",
    "    \n",
    "    while market.update():\n",
    "        update_count += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    print(f\"Markets {market_count} Updates {update_count}\", end='\\r')\n",
    "print(f\"Markets {market_count} Updates {update_count}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "## Types\n",
    "IDE's should automatically detect the types and provide checking and auto complete. See the [pyi stub file](betfair_data.pyi) for a comprehensive view of the types and method available.\n",

    "Benchmarks were run against 3 months of Australian racing markets comprising roughly 22,000 markets. Benchmarks were run on a M1 Macbook Pro with 32GB ram.\n",

    "These results should only be used as a rough comparison, different machines, different sports and even different months can effect the performance and overall markets/updates per second.\n",

    "No disrespect is intended towards betfairlightweight, which remains an amazing library and a top choice for working with the Betfair API. Every effort was made to have its benchmark below run as fast as possible, and any improvements are welcome.\n",
